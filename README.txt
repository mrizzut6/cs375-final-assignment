Run with ./submission. This program currently generates a solvable Sudoku puzzle with 10 blank spaces, then solves it
using a naive brute-force approach, then solves it again with backtracking. The original puzzle and both solutions are
printed out (blank spaces are represented with 0). Brute-force and backtracking solutions are timed.

TODO:
- Make sure generated puzzles are unambiguous. This could be done by changing the backtrack function to return a number of solutions.
- Add better user interface stuff (optional) - reading/writing puzzles to files, prompts to generate/solve, custom number of blank spaces.

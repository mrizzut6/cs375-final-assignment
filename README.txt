Run with ./submission <blank-spaces> <backtrack>. This program generates a solvable Sudoku puzzle with a number of blank spaces defined by the user (9 if not specified), or as many blank spaces as possible to give an unambiguous solution. It then solves the puzzle using a naive brute-force approach, then again with backtracking. If the program is run with "backtrack", the brute-force approach is skipped (recommended with 10 or more blank spaces). The original puzzle and solution or solutions are printed out (blank spaces are represented with 0). Brute-force and backtracking solutions are timed.
